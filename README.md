## Hello there!

This is a pet project to make it easier to track health symptoms throughout the day.
It will be for iPhone initially, followed by Apple Watch and others, and is designed to allow you to quickly record a symptom you are experiencing. Gathering data points on your health is one of the easiest steps you can take right now to improving your health through a better understanding of what is actually happening with you. 


> I understand that our bodies are complex systems that require attention and care. Similar to how we would troubleshoot and improve a machine or piece of code by adding sensors or logging, gathering data and metrics is crucial in understanding our own bodies and identifying areas for improvement. By tracking symptoms and monitoring our health, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions to improve our well-being. 


This is very much a work in progress. I hope to publish it to the app store as a free app once it reaches version `1.0.0`.
